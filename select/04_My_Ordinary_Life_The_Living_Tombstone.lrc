[00:03.35] よ！ じゃぁ 行こうぞ！ ジャンケンポン！
[00:13.85] 
[00:30.04] They tell me, "Keep it simple", I tell them, "Take it slow"
[00:32.78] I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
[00:35.53] I tell them, "Take it easy", they laugh and tell me, "No"
[00:38.22] It's cool but I don't see them laughing at my money though
[00:40.84] They spitting facts at me, I'm spitting tracks, catch me?
[00:43.70] I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can't combat me
[01:12.70] 
[00:46.48] They tell me, "Jesus walks", I tell them, "Money talks"
[00:49.17] Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an icebox
[00:51.92] They tell me I've been sleeping, I say, "I'm wide awake"
[00:54.63] Tracks hot and ready so they call me Mister Easy-Bake
[00:57.32] They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
[01:00.01] Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank
[01:24.51] 
[01:03.19] Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
[01:05.31] The people always different but it always feels the same
[01:08.43] That's the real me, pop the champagne
[01:10.87] The haters wanna hurt me and I'm laughin' at the pain
[01:37.37] 
[01:13.95] Stayin' still, eyes closed
[01:16.32] Let the world just pass me by
[01:19.43] Pain pills, nice clothes
[01:21.98] If I fall, I think I'll fly
[01:24.79] Touch me, Midas
[01:27.40] Make me part of your design
[01:30.33] None to guide us
[01:32.76] I feel fear for the very last time
[01:49.76] 
[01:57.16] They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
[02:00.19] I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
[02:02.82] They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red"
[02:05.68] They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled
[02:08.28] They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
[02:10.96] Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
[02:41.46] 
[02:13.83] They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade
[02:16.23] Six-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feeling odd
[02:19.14] No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
[02:21.87] Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
[02:24.65] They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
[02:27.19] The people blend together but I would be lost without their love
[02:59.19] 
[02:30.18] Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
[02:32.33] When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
[02:35.56] Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
[02:38.10] It hurts me just to think and I don't do pain
[03:00.60] 
[02:41.37] Stayin' still, eyes closed
[02:43.68] Let the world just pass me by
[02:46.51] Pain pills, nice clothes
[02:49.27] If I fall, I think I'll fly
[02:52.10] Touch me, Midas
[02:54.85] Make me part of your design
[02:57.44] None to guide us
[02:59.95] I feel fear for the very last time
[03:16.95] 
[03:03.37] Lay still, restless
[03:05.57] Losing sleep while I lose my mind
[03:08.64] All thrill, no stress
[03:10.97] All my muses left behind (left behind)
[03:14.07] World is below
[03:16.38] So high up, I'm near-divine (I'm so high up)
[03:19.53] Lean in, let go
[03:21.83] I feel fear for the very last time
